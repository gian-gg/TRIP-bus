# Project Overview

TRIP — Transit Routing & Integrated Payments

An integrated transit ticketing and routing system. Explore the interfaces in this repo to see how QR-based boarding, conductor dashboards, and passenger alerts work together.

## Quick Actions (UI)

- QR Code Interface — passenger boarding flow
- Conductor Dashboard — manage seats and trips
- Backend connection test (dev helper)

## Main Features

- **Dynamic Form QR-Code:** A QR code that embeds the current location of the bus and automatically inputs it to the form to reduce fare evasion.
- **Passenger Form:** Enables passengers to input trip details and provides consistent and accurate fare calculation.
- **Bus Actions & Alerts:** Real-time conductor alerts and bus stop requests with a single action from the passenger UI.
- **Conductor Dashboard:** Seat-plan-based arrangement to display passengers and seats for easy supervision.
- **Local Connection:** Designed for local connectivity so passengers can access features even without full internet access.

## Disclaimer

This deployment is a showcase for demonstration purposes. The project is intended to be deployed locally per bus or vehicle for testing and demonstration. Do not rely on this instance for live operations or production use.
